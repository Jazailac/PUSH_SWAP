## Pro Tips for Success
1. Stay consistent with daily goals
2. Take short breaks to maintain focus
3. Test incrementally after each major implementation
4. Don't get discouraged by initial challenges
5. Seek help from peers or forums if stuck

## Recommended Daily Schedule
- Morning (2-3 hours): Coding and implementation
- Afternoon (1-2 hours): Testing and optimization
- Evening (1 hour): Review progress, plan next steps
